# Aharonov_Bohm_Ring_Simulation
The Current vs. Voltage and Transmission Graphs of Aharonov Bohm Rings

GENERAL INFORMATION:
This simulation is designed to replicate the atomic structure of the
Aharonov-Bohm ring proposed by Motohiko Ezawa in his paper called
"Peculiar band gap structure of graphene nanoribbons" in Fig 7 - e
The structure has been slightly modified on the edges in order to
ensure current flow and voltage intake. The band gap has been previously
determined for the structure using a seperate band gap structure code,
which is equal to 0.346668 for the given structure.

BEFORE YOU RUN THE CODE:
You can adjust the structure of the nanoribbon in the "#Make Cut"
section. This allows you to cut different antidotes on the nanoribbon
and uses symmetry to replicate the antidote on all 4 corners of the
structure. However, please keep in mind that this will change the
variables such as n, Hex_N, Ch_l and D_w; which you should adjust
accordingly. Also keep in mind that running this code might take
some time (roughly 10-20 minutes), but as long as new loop numbers
are being printed, everything should be working just fine. Please
don't forget to install the necessary libraries beforehand.

Thank you for using my code and I hope that it will be benefitial
for you in your research efforts.
